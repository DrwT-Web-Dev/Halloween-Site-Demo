                ───────────────────────────────────────────────<br>
                CLASSIFICATION: DECLASSIFIED<br>
                DATE RELEASED: 10/12/1994<br>
                ORIGINAL REPORT DATE: NOV. 14, 1974<br>
                REPORTING OFFICER: SGT. D.H. MOORE<br>
                SUBJECT: MISSING PERSON / UNATTENDED DEATH<br>
                ───────────────────────────────────────────────<br><br>

                SUMMARY:<br>
                At approximately 9:40 P.M. on OCTOBER 21, 1974, a call was received <br>
                from one BELINDA WELLS (F, 43) of [REDACTED] Township reporting her <br>
                husband, FREDRICH WELLS (M, 47), missing from their property on <br>
                COUNTY ROUTE [REDACTED]. Mrs. Wells stated her husband had last been <br>
                seen tending the pumpkin fields during dense fog conditions earlier <br>
                that evening.<br><br>

                A search effort was organized the following morning with local <br>
                volunteers and township deputies. The search was impeded by <br>
                visibility under ten feet and was ultimately suspended after <br>
                a severe storm front moved over the area. Subject remained missing. <br><br>

                ───────────────────────────────────────────────<br>
                FOLLOW-UP:<br>
                On OCTOBER 31, 1974, Mrs. Wells contacted neighbors regarding a <br>
                "foul odor" emanating from the shed behind the residence. Witnesses <br>
                reported seeing her enter the structure shortly before dusk. <br>
                No further contact was made with Mrs. Wells.<br><br>

                On NOVEMBER 14, 1974, Deputies responded to the property to conduct <br>
                a welfare check after Mrs. Wells failed to answer calls or collect <br>
                mail. Entry was gained through an unlocked rear door.<br><br>

                Inside the shed, officers discovered one deceased female, later <br>
                confirmed to be BELINDA WELLS, lying prone on the floor, left hand <br>
                clutching a 12-gauge shotgun registered to F. Wells. <br><br>

                On a worktable approximately four feet from the body was a human <br>
                head, identified through dental records as belonging to FREDRICH <br>
                WELLS. The head showed deliberate mutilation. Eyes and mouth had <br>
                been excised and carved into a grin resembling a jack-o'-lantern. <br>
                Despite the elapsed time since the subject’s disappearance, <br>
                tissue showed minimal decomposition. Beside the remains was a<br>
                Halloween card containing the message [REDACTED]<br><br>
